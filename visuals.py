|  In the depths of the stormy sea, there sailed a fearsome       |
|  pirate, known across the seven seas for his treachery and      |
|  cunning. Yet, the hand of fate had finally caught up with him  |
|  as he found himself shackled by the iron chains of the         |
|  government, his fate dangling like a pendulum over the abyss.  |
|  The court, ruled by righteous men with hearts as cold as the   |
|  ocean depths, decreed that his sins must be accounted for,     |
|  his judgment to be decided by the ancient laws of the pirate   |
|  code.                                                          |
|                                                                 |
|  With a heavy heart and a glint of defiance in his eyes, the    |
|  pirate stood before the tribunal, where a cryptic challenge    |
|  awaited him. Seven deadly sins, whispered the whispers of the  |
|  wind, each more perilous than the rolling waves that had been  |
|  his home.                                                      |
|                                                                 |
|"Gula" "Luxuria" "Avaritia" "Tristitia" "Ira" "Acedia" "Superbia"|
|                                                                 |
|  With each sin spoken, the pirate's heart grew heavier, for     |
|  he knew that only by solving the riddle of the sins could he   |
|  escape the noose that awaited him. Seven chances, like the     |
|  seven tides that swept him to his fate, were all he had.       |
|                                                                 |
|  With the weight of his sins pressing down upon him like the    |
|  crushing depths of the abyss, the pirate set forth on his      |
|  perilous quest, knowing that one misstep would condemn him     |
|  to a watery grave, lost forever to the annals of pirate lore.  |
|                                                                 |
|                                                                 |
|                   Rules: You have 7 attempts to solve the word  |
|                          before the game is over.               |
|                                                                 |
